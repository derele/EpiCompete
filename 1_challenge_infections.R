    ## calculate OPG for now but just max (see below)

## FIXME in the data processing!!!

## Filter accordingly and summarize the data for max oocysts and max
## weight loss per mouse and infection (first, challenge),

## summarize by mouse and infection (challenge/primary)
as_tibble(CI) %>%

### now: we have discoverd that in E57 mice the E88 innoculum used for
### re-infection was "not working" those mice are actually "unifected"
CIMouse[CIMouse$challenge_infection%in%"E88", "challenge_infection"]  <- "UNI"
