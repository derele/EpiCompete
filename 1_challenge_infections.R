## For an analysis of immune protection we want the following
## categories in one column
CI$infection_type <- NA
## primary_E88
CI$infection_type[CI$infection_history%in%"UNI_E88" &
                  CI$infection%in%"challenge"] <-  "primary_E88"

CI$infection_type[CI$infection_history%in%"E64_E88" &
                  CI$infection%in%"challenge"] <-  "heterologous_E88"

## summarize by mouse and infection (challenge/primary)
as_tibble(CI) %>%
    group_by(EH_ID, infection) %>%
    summarize(max_OOC = max(OOC, na.rm=TRUE),
              max_WL = min(relative_weight, na.rm=TRUE),
              ## do this more elegantly!
              experiment = unique(experiment),

              infection_history=unique(infection_history),
              infection_type=unique(infection_type)) ->
    CIMouse



### This wider format might be more usable and more intuitive:
CIMouse %>%  
    pivot_wider(names_from = infection,
                values_from = c(max_OOC, max_WL)) ->
    CIMouseW


## object genereated in this script are: 

## CI - challenge infection full dataset for all dpi

## CIMouse - challenge infection dataset with per mouse and infection
## type (challenge/primary) max oocyst and max weight loss

## CIMouseW - same as CIMouse but wide format with different columns
## for the infection types (for each weight loss and oocyst shedding)
